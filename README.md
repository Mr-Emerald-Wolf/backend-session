# Backend-Session

Welcome to the Backend-Session repository! This project provides a Node.js API using MongoDB and Express for building backend applications.

## Features

- CRUD operations with MongoDB for data storage
- RESTful API routes using Express
- Easy-to-extend architecture for adding new endpoints and features
- Error handling and validation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=14.0.0)
- MongoDB instance (local or remote)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mr-emerald-wolf/backend-session.git
   cd backend-session
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your MongoDB connection details:

   ```env
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

The API server will run at http://localhost:3000 by default. You can modify the port in the `.env` file.

API Endpoints:

- GET `/api/items`: Get all items
- GET `/api/items/:id`: Get item by ID
- POST `/api/items`: Create a new item
- PUT `/api/items/:id`: Update an item by ID
